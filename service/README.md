## Develop senarios

- Pricing per hour - best for started becaouse you dont know to avaluate the time needed for a project.

- Pricing per project - charging by a total cost. the customer knows the price. but it involved to know how long (aproxcematly) the project must take ( advice to take a spare time include).

- Pricing per manday - a nix between hourly and project.

- Minimum price/retainer - good for beginers. because we need to learn the customer system (how does he works). its good to learn. after you can switch to other plan.
