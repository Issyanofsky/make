![what can you charge for](/pic/what_can_you_charge_for.gif)

## Pricing per hour - best for started becaouse you dont know to avaluate the time needed for a project.

## Pricing per project - charging by a total cost. the customer knows the price. but it involved to know how long (aproxcematly) the project must take ( advice to take a spare time include).

## Pricing per manday - a nix between hourly and project.

## Minimum price/retainer - good for beginers. because we need to learn the customer system (how does he works). its good to learn. after you can switch to other plan.
