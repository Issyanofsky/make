# Definitions and terminology
</div>


1. __Bundle__ - a chunk of data and the basic unit for use with modules. A bundle consists of items, similar to how a bag may contain separate, individual items.
2. __Item__ - data that is part of a bundle.
  1. __Collections__ - a set of different data items.
  2. __Arrays__ - data items of the same type. Array items have "[ ]" at the end of the item name in the mapping panel.

3. __Scenario__ - series of app modules connected to perform a task or automate a process or workflow.
4. __Module__ - the main building block of automation in Make. Modules represent actions that Make performs with an app. Each app typically contains several modules that read, create, update, and delete data.
5. Scenario "execution" is a synonym for scenario "run".
6. Generally speaking, Make will charge for operations whenever a bundle passes through a module but there are certain modules that don't charge operations.
7. Mapping Panel lets you map items coming from preceding modules into the current module.
