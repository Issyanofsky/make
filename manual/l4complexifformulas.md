# Complex IF Formulas
</div>


__Things to remember:

1. Make can support very long if(...) functions that include multiple conditions and other if(...) functions inside.
2. You can use both __and / or__ operators to define your conditions.
3. In some instances, it might be just easier to copy your long function to a text editor and make your edits there.
4. Hovering over function names or opening/closing parenthesis in Make's modules will highlight the closing/opening parenthesis of the function.

__Try yourself:__

1. Find all single-word countries where the first letter of their name does not match the first letter from their 2-digit ISO code.
2. Find all multiple-word countries where the first letter of their name does not match the first letter from their 2-digit ISO code.
