# Real AI Use Case


</div>

__Things to remember:__

1. Be specific when providing instructions to AI.
2. Always check and test the outcomes produced - be ready to iterate your prompts multiple times until you start consistently getting expected results.
3. Whenever possible, instruct AI modules to return JSON structures back so you can easily map the outputs in the subsequent modules. Don't forget to turn on "Parse Response" option in the OpenAI>Create a Prompt module.
4. Keep in mind that the longer prompts you send to various AI tools (such as OpenAI), the more API credits you are going to pay to process the prompt. The similar applies to outputs of the prompts - the longer the output is, the more costly it's going to be.
5. In case you are going to build a similar use case, you will need to get Gmail label IDs so you can later map them in the "Labels to add" field in Modify Email Labels module. The most elegant approach is to simply open this module and select a label for which you need the ID and then turn on the mapping as shown below. This will tell you what the ID for each label value is.
