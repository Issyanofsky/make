# Troubleshooting

1. When working with webhooks, remember to always configure your webhook first, and then run your scenario so the mapping data becomes available.
2. Use "Run this module only" for testing individual modules.
3. Module fields that are displayed in __bold__ are required. If your preceding module outputs an empty field, you will receive the “Missing value” error.
4. It's completely OK if your scenarios fail during development - it's part of the process!
5. Clicking the "History" button in the "Scenario details" section displays information about all scenario runs, including errors.
