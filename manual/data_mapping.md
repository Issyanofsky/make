# Data mapping
</div>


  * Mapping items between modules can be achieved by simply clicking items in the mapping panel or by dragging and dropping them from the mapping panel.
  * Whenever you need to map items that aren't available in the mapping panel, you can hardcode them by using the __double-curly brackets trick__. E. g. you can type {{1.order.order_id}}. Just keep in mind that you always need to refer to __"raw names"__.
  * Even mapped items can be copied and pasted between modules: Just select them and use CTRL+C and CTRL+V on your keyboard to copy and paste, respectively. Sometimes you may need to go a step further and copy a mapped item (or a combination of inline functions) out of Make and edit it as plain text in a text editor - and then paste it back to Make. This is very useful when you need to edit long nested inline functions.
