</div>

1. You can "chain" or "nest" functions together. You are not limited to using just one function for an item. For example: addMonths(addSeconds({{now}};2);13).
2. Beware of all possible date/time tokens which can be used for date/time formatting - full list on the link below.
3. Please check advanced use cases of date/time functions here. The article covers:
   1. How to calculate days between dates - extremely useful!
   2. How to calculate the nth day of the week in a month.
   3. How to transform seconds into hours and minutes.
      
4. General functions such as if(...), ifempty(...), switch(...) allow you to build conditional logic within your mapping.
