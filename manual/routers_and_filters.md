# Routers and Filters
</div>

1. It's extremely important to use the correct data type operators when setting up filters. "Contains" from Text operators is not the same as "Contains" from Array operators.
2. Make sure you understand in which order the routes behind a router are executed (=based on the order they were connected to the router).
3. Changing the order of routes behind a router can be solved in 3 ways:
   1. You can simply delete the router and add a new one to the same position and link subsequent routers in the desired order.
   2. You can unlink the existing routes and then link them in the desired order.
   3. Right click a Router and reorder the routes in the pop up by dragging and dropping them.
  
4. Filters can be used after any module.
5. The Auto-align button can help you quickly organize your complex scenarios.
