__Things to remember:__

1. Your scenarios may generate random errors which will not be your fault. For example, it's possible that one of the modules in the scenario fails because the API of the particular app is not responding for a very short period of time.
2. You can solve these situations by using error-handling modules such as Ignore, Break, or Resume.
3. You can even create alternate routes with a series of steps to solve the error. Right-click a potentially failing module > Add error handler > Select any app on Make.
4. Error handlers are especially useful when you know certain errors will be repeatedly happening and when you already know how to handle these errors.
