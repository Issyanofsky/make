__Things to remember:__

1. An array is a list of items.
2. Arrays can be identified by having "[ ]" at the end of item names in the mapping panel.
3. Array functions can help you save operations and lots of steps that would otherwise have to be done via standalone modules.
4. Hover over the individual value field to see the Raw name of the field.
5. get(...) function allows you to access nested elements, using dot notation.
6. split(...) function lets you create arrays from text strings.
7. join(...) function lets you create a simple text string from a primitive array.
