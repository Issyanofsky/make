Sales Activities & Referral Fees

In order to receive the referral fees, you must follow the three main steps below:





Before we go deeper into the actual sales process, let's quickly align on the key sales activities which are introduced in the official Make Partner Program and explain how the partner can engage with the opportunity in order to be eligible for a specific referral fee. The main three sales activities and engagement for Enterprise opportunities are:

1. Lead Sourcing = Sourcing the opportunity by introducing relevant Enterprise end customer stakeholders to the Make team and registering the opportunity using the opportunity registration form

2. Co-selling = Participating or initiating key meetings with the end customer. Supporting our team during the PoC phase with expert industry customer know-how if a PoC is part of the sale cycle. Executing the PoC with or without our support. Playing an important role during the opportunity sales cycle.

3. Service Delivery =  Partner provides post-sales service and plays a crucial role to help to build a strong relationship with the customer to grow their account and support future upsell opportunities

You can find more details about the referral fees and their structure in the partner program guide document which is shared with you individually by the Make Partnership Team.



End-to-end sales cycle

The whole end-to-end sales cycle is outlined in the visual below and during this chapter, we are going to go into more detail with each step.





Stage 1 - Lead Identification & Qualification

The whole sales cycle starts with lead identification which means that you search within your current network of potential customers or proactively prospect new leads and customers within the ideal customer profile group.

Stage 3 - Discovery & Progression

Start building your business case and agree on the PoV/PoC process if necessary. In this stage, it is important to present a feasible business case with a structured execution plan that will meet all the technical requirements and solve the issues for the customer. After successful identification of the business case, engage with the GTM sales team to handle possible security questionnaires, pricing of the enterprise plan, and quoting.



Important Steps

Align the scope and define clearly measurable goals of the use case with the end customer
Collaborate with the customer to ensure all technical requirements are solved during the PoC/PoV process
If necessary, collaborate with the GTM sales team to answer a security questionnaire (follow the process described below)
If needed, cooperate with the GTM team to provide Enterprise trial instance → objectives, requirements, and stakeholders are described in the visual below
Engage with the GTM Team to properly scope the operations and finalize the quote for the customer
With larger deals (above $50k ACV) Start preparing the MDP plan with the solution engineering team and the end customer

MDP (Mutual Delivery Plan) between Customer & Make 

The purpose of the Mutual Delivery Plan is to clearly define responsibility and account for the various work streams that occur during a Make implementation. As a means of ensuring Customer success, representatives from the Customer, Make and the partner (where appropriate) mutually agree and document the tasks, owners, timeline, and budgetary guidance to ensure alignment. 



Desired Outcome

You have agreed on the business case and technical scope of the project with the end customer. If necessary, you have cooperated with the GTM sales team to answer a security questionnaire and engaged with the Account Executive in pricing & packaging discussions and alignment

Make PoV Framework

To help you progress the deal in the right direction, you should cooperate with the Make team in building a successful PoV (Proof of Value) project but make sure to get a certain level of commitment from the customer.



Enterprise Security Review Support

Some larger companies (usually above 500 employees or companies that handle sensitive data) require full security review support. During this process, the security team from the end customer requests a security review to answer questions regarding Make data handling and security. If the customer requests this type of assessment, please follow the steps below. This type of support is only available with the Enterprise plan, therefore it should be pretty clear which plan is suitable for these types of customers.





Scope the Project - Enterprise Pricing & Packaging

Enterprise Plan offers flexible pricing and packaging that is customized for every single customer. During the co-selling activity, you will be cooperating with the Account Executive to finalize the pricing and send out a quote to the customer. Here is the overview of the process. 

Please, do not engage in detailed pricing discussions with the customer before consulting it with the Make GTM team!
