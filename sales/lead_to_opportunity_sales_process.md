Before we go deeper into the actual sales process, let's quickly align on the key sales activities which are introduced in the official Make Partner Program and explain how the partner can engage with the opportunity in order to be eligible for a specific referral fee. The main three sales activities and engagement for Enterprise opportunities are:

__1. Lead Sourcing__ = Sourcing the opportunity by introducing relevant Enterprise end customer stakeholders to the Make team and registering the opportunity using the opportunity registration form

__2. Co-selling__ = Participating or initiating key meetings with the end customer. Supporting our team during the PoC phase with expert industry customer know-how if a PoC is part of the sale cycle. Executing the PoC with or without our support. Playing an important role during the opportunity sales cycle.

__3. Service Delivery__ =  Partner provides post-sales service and plays a crucial role to help to build a strong relationship with the customer to grow their account and support future upsell opportunities

You can find more details about the referral fees and their structure in the partner program guide document which is shared with you individually by the Make Partnership Team.

__Enterprise Security Review Support__

Some larger companies (usually above 500 employees or companies that handle sensitive data) require full security review support. During this process, the security team from the end customer requests a security review to answer questions regarding Make data handling and security. If the customer requests this type of assessment, please follow the steps below. This type of support is only available with the Enterprise plan, therefore it should be pretty clear which plan is suitable for these types of customers.
