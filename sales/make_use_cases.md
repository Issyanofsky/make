# Initial Common Use Cases with Make

When initiating discussions with prospects and customers, there are two main situations that can occur:

  1. The prospect has already identified the current problem and challenges he/she faces in the business. It might be use cases in their marketing department when they want to synchronize data between their CRM )HubSpot or Salesforce) and Marketing engine system (Pardot or Mrketo). Or the HR team would like to automate their onboarding processes or integrate their HCM system (Workday) with their acquisition platform (Greenhouse) and others --> __In  this case, you should deep dive into these problems, build a successful POC & POV processes, and discuss with customers on the next step.__
  2. The prospect does not have many ideas about automation potential and need help with discovering the use cases across her/his field of expertise. There are several initial point-to-point solutions and use cases that can work pretty much any company. if these are successfully executed, it should open the door to more complex use cases across the entire organization in the future. Here ara a few examples:
     - __Data retrieval, normalization, and writing into database from external websites.__
     - __Filling out forms and regulatory compiance.__
     - __Getting data into a usable format.__
     - __Automatic accross creation flow__
       
       a. Creating tickets
       
       b. Notifying people - saves 30 min of manual work per new hire.
       
     - __Synchronize records from your CRM (Salesforce) into the project management tool (Monday.com).__
     - __IT - Password retrival anytime somebody forget a password.__
       
Those are out-of-the-box use cases that work for most of our customers in almost every situation. And they should lead to more complex solutions across other departments within the company. __Your ultimate goal should be to expand the use cases beyond the inital point solution and create more demand foe the following use cases in Marketing, HR, E-commerce operations, or customer support.__
