# How to properly initiate the discussions about use cases?

There are several ways to initiate a discussion with the customer about their use cases and current business situation. You as a partner have a close relationship with your network so we believe in your judgment to sense the situation. However, there is a certain methodology called POC (Proof of Concept) that contains a set of guidelines that should allow you the identify the problem, offer a solution, and estimate the impact on the customer's business. 

## PoC Guide

__Current State__ (Have customer fill this out in their own words) 

  - Describes the customer's prevailing situation from a business operational perspective
  - Provides insights into their day-to-day issues
  - Lists what the customer is experiencing to draw into a POC

__Future State__ (Have customers fill this out in their own words)

  - Describes customer's expected future aspirations or requirements from business and operational perspective
    
__Business Imperatives__ (Have customers fill this out in their own words)

  - Identifies customer's business imperatives as it relates to their requirements to improve their current state
   
__The Gap__ (Have customers fill this out in their own words)

  - List what is currently missing from a business and operational perspective. What is not possible today in their environment?
  - Have this section be a bullet list of short descriptive points
   
__Outcomes__ (this is authored by you as the technical expert or the Solution Engineer from the Make sales team)

  - Essential to have clearly stated Outcomes based on the context of this PoC and not the capabilities of the entire proposed solution before the next steps with the customer
  - Required outcomes of the PoC span, tactical or experimental outcomes 
  - A business description of how your proposed solution aligns with the Current State

__Proposed Solution__ (this is authored by you as the technical expert or the Solution Engineer from the Make sales team - keep it short)

  - Describe the proposed solution that will be used in the PoC.
  - Use boilerplate descriptions that are already written and available from your product marketing site - unless there is an aspect of your solution that will not be used or needs to be excluded - use standard content and avoid building a customer description.

__Scope__

  - Include a limited set of clearly defined and measurable goals 
  - Clearly state that the environment is temporary and cannot be used as a production environment

__Success Criteria__

  - Capture items that define the primary success of the PoC. Evidence of how your solution meets customer requirements
  - At this point, we pivot from a business focus to identifying what is done technically to show a customer the value of the solution (what is done by the sales engineer)

__Technical Requirements__

  - The technical requirements needed to enable the setup and execution of the PoC environment
  - Collaboration with customers to ensure these technical requirements can be met from a physical setup, security access, and timing

__Assumptions__

  - Document all customer and solution vendor assumptions 
  - Who is doing what, what will be completed and when 

__Timeline__

  - Clearly define the timeline in which the PoC will be executed
  - Manage the right events and ensure the right people are aligned at the right time to move PoC forward 
  - Avoid asking the customer how long they want the PoC to run - you or the Solution Engineer should guide customers on when the PoC can be completed

__Roles and Responsibilities__

  - List roles and responsibilities of active participants and stakeholders in PoC
  - Include proper names, titles, roles, and contact information
  - Make sure you have the following four customer categories identified and engaged
    - __Executives__ - can confirm the need for PoC and ensure that time and resources allocated are supported by the budget
    - __Middle Managers__ - vital enablers who remain aware of the PoC and ensure that the right team members are and stay engaged 
    - __Customer participants__ -  individuals who will test, validate, advise and actively participate in the PoC
    - __Decision makers__ -  include people who need to approve decisions and most importantly those involved in the purchasing process

__Sequence of Events__

  - Identify timelines and critical milestones of specific events to ensure the right actions, meetings, and activities necessary to complete PoC 

__Closure__

  - Define when the PoC ends - specifically how the PoC environment, process, and team wind down 


* You will be able to find the PoC template guide and other supporting materials on the Partner Portal once you sign the partnership contract.


## How to run a successful PoV process

The PoV (Proof of Value) is a combination of a PoC (Proof of Concept) and the communication of the expected business value of a solution

Make PoV Framework

Not all PoVs are the same and it is important to be able to distinguish between different types of involvement of the partner and the Make Sales team. Each type has its Pros and Cons and we hope that this brief overview will help you to steer the discussion and engagement with the customer to the desired directions

Build a Business Case for Enterprise Customers

There are several ways how you can start building use cases for your customers. The Make Solution Engineering team for example leverages the Miro lane diagram to display certain layers within the systems and the involvement of Make as a glue between the different tools. The visual below describes an HR onboarding use case and account activation for a new hire in the company. The applications like GreenHouse, Google Sheets, or Jira are displayed only as examples and can in reality be substituted by multiple equivalents such as Microsoft Excel, Airtable, Monday.com, or anything that the customer currently uses

1.0 HR Onboarding - account provisioning use case





1.1 HR Onboarding - account provisioning use case after Make

As you can see in the diagram below, automation with Make reduces the number of steps within the process from 12 to 9, which streamlined the whole process. We believe that the visual illustrations displayed in these two pictures can help the customer:

Understand the current process much better
Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies 
Grasp the value of Make faster 
Estimate the impact on the business
In reality, this diagram can look very different depending on each individual customer, their processes, and systems the use.



Here are some final tips on how to build a business case for Enterprise Customers

Active listening
Understand the pain
Listen for technology specification
Ask the right discovery questions (see the PoC guide at the beginning of the lesson)
The usual requirements for getting a PoC approved from a prospect
Start and end date (Ideally 2 weeks, max up to 4 weeks with special approval)
Clear success criteria
Prospect agrees to recommend Make as a solution to purchase if success criteria are reached
Create a communication channel with all involved stakeholders (i.e. Slack)
Understand the buying process
Legal and IT review process is understood and running during the PoC
Final decision-making meeting scheduled during Po
