# Enterprise Customers

There are two main types of Enterprise customers:
  1. The first type is a mid-size to large Enterprise that is looking to automate a specific line of their business like marketing or HR processes.
  2. The second type is fast-frowing mid-size to medium-large companies that are looking for an automation tool that will allow them to scale and grow their business efficiently.

here are some example of these two types of Enterprise customers:

# Common Use Cases with Make

There is a large number of automation use cases, but we would like to give you a few examples and ideas where we see great strength and success of Make within most of our existing customers.

   1. On the left side, you'll find use cases that are points that can solve immediate problems in almost any company. these are useful when you need to create a business case because the prospect doesn't have an immediate challenge to solve.
   2. After the successful implementation of the initial use cases, you should navigate the customer to more complex cross-departmental use cases - on the right side youll se most frequent cases. however, the list continues as every single customer has a slightly unique situation and use cases.

Across these use cases, there is a plethora of different applications that could be used in different situations. Every customer might use a different system. More then 1,400 applications are already available on Make and each has several API endpoints that can be use within the scenarios.

In larger companies, the very common applications can be substituted by Enterprise apps within the same use case:
