## Targeting and Prospecting

In this lesson, we will guide you through some of the foundations of the business development process which is targeting and prospecting new Enterprise leads. 

There are several key steps that will allow you to generate the right leads with a high potential of converting into opportunities:

__1. Find the right companies__

Create a target list that consists of companies that match the ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)  from the previous lessons. Create a list of 100 targeted accounts (companies) that you would like to focus on.

__2. Select the correct personas__

As soon as you create a list of the right companies that you would like to target, make sure that you focus on the right personas within these companies that would be the right "Champions" for you within the company.

__3. Collect the right contact information__

Make sure that once you find the right personas, you have a scalable way to collect the contact information (email, phone number) to reach out to these personas.

__4. Insert the contacts into the sales cadence__

After collecting the contact information from your targeted list, insert the contacts into a multi-touch sales cadence including phone calls, emails, and other social media outreach to have the highest possibility of response.

## Outreach Sales Cadence

  - Before we go into more detail regarding sales cadences, let's go over some basic sales definitions of cadencing.
    
__Sales Cadence__ = a sequence of touchpoints with a prospect to establish a connection for engagement or a sales

__Buyer Persona__ = research-based profile that depicts a target or ideal customer

__Sales Segments__  = separate strategies of approach to appeal to consumers with different needs, interests, budgets, or other attributes

__Industry Best Practices__

There are no silver bullets to a sales cadence but we gathered together some industry best practices to keep in mind when creating your own cadence

__1. Multi-touch cadence__

  - It takes roughly 7-13 touches to reach a prospect which means cadence should have 10-15 touchpoints (it was reported that sales reps who make 12 or more attempts perform 20% better than colleagues who stop at 8)
  - Ensure multiple methods of contact are implemented in your cadence
    - LinkedIn connection requests
    - Linked voice messages
    - Emails
    - Phone calls
    - Short videos of the product (1.5 min) to be sent via LinkedIn
      
__2. Timing is (almost) everything__

  - Wait at least a day between contact attempts but no more than 4
  - Spread cadence over a 2 to 4-week period (this ensures you are persistent but not clingy)
    
__3. Contact the right way with the right content__

  - Warm-up prospect with an email or social media contact (i.e. Linkedin message or connection request) to build familiarity
  - Send content that will resonate with the prospect (use cases, pain points, challenges, industry standards)
  - Make each contact and (Cadence) intentional
    
__4. Test your cadence and adjust as needed__

  - Consistently observe the effectiveness of your cadence and adjust it
  - Few things to keep an eye on
    - Number of touches to get a response
    - Open rate % (industry standard between 17-28%)
    - Click rate % (industry standard 2-5%)
    - Select a type of content that is relevant

## Lead Qualification 

There are several qualification methods that you can use to qualify the lead and our team has selected the GPCA method which works consistently well to qualify the leads in the initial stage and move it to the next sales phase.

__Goals__

  - Ask the prospects about their priorities and goals for the short and long-term future
  - Include the personal goals of that persona
  - What goals they would like to achieve with Make as a company and as individual
    
__Plans__

  - How they are planning to implement Make and what are their resources?

__Challenges__

  - What challenges and pain points do they currently face?
    - Negative Economic Factors (e.g. recession, cost-cutting, lay-offs, etc)
    - Positive Economic Factors (e.g. business growth, lack of capacity and resources)
    - Process Pains (e.g. slow and inefficient processes)
    - Data inaccuracies (e.g. data do not sync between different systems and platforms)
  - What are the main process issues that they would like to solve?
  - What are the bottlenecks and road blockers?
    
__Authority__

  - What is the role and responsibility of the prospect?
    - Is the person an important stakeholder that can influence the deal (Champion)?
    - Is it an executive that has the power to sign off on a budget for a new tool in the company (Decision Maker)?
  - What would be the reason to use Make?
