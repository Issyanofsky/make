Stage 4 - Opportunity closing

We are getting to the final stage of the sales cycle which requires a special focus on small details and executive alignment. However, ensure that the regional Make Sales Director is involved in the opportunity from the very beginning. It is imperative to keep overcommunicating with all the stakeholders and decision-makers between the Make and end customer parties. 

Besides the regional Sales Director, the Make Executive sponsor such as the VP of Sales, VP of Ecosystem, or the CEO should be involved in the closing of the deal together with the Account Executive who owns the opportunity. Procurement steps such as Order Form creation and any adjustments to the contract should be handled in parallel by the Make Account Executive, not sequentially. 

Align with Customer Success and Solution engineering on MDP (Mutual Delivery Plan) team to make sure they have enough resources and prepare for customer onboarding and post-sales services.



Important Processes

The Order Form/quote has to be created by the Account Executive and adjustments need to be finalized
Make the Account Executive engage with the Celonis Deal Desk team 
Any adjustments to the MSA/Contract (Master Service Agreement are handled by the Deal Desk team)
Pricing & Executive alignment with all crucial stakeholders/decision-makers 
Over-communication is a key
After an alignment with the Account Executive and the Partnership manager, feel free to invite Make Executive sponsors (CEO, VP of Sales, VP of Product) - our philosophy is "best team wins" so the whole team is committed to contributing to the successful closure of the deal
With larger deals (above $50k ACV = annual contract value), MDP (mutual delivery plan) with Solution Engineering is highly recommended. More details on the MDP will be described in the later stage of the lesson.
Desired Outcome

By the end of the sales cycle, the executive decision-maker from the end customer should be ready to sign the contract via DocuSign. This should be followed by all necessary steps taken to prepare customers for successful onboarding and post-sales services

Contractual Documents

There are a couple of very important documents that you as a partner need to understand in order to better position the Enterprise plan and communicate all the details to the customer correctly. Firstly, let's introduce the Enterprise Order Form creation process and important terms and conditions within the contract.

Enterprise Order Form/Quote

Firstly, you as a partner always need to communicate with the Make Account Executive in order to create a quote for the customer. The AE is the full owner of the process. 

Terms and Conditions of the contract

Order Form = main contractual document that the customer signs
MSA (Master Services Agreement) is a part of the Order Form (Celonis is a parent company of Make)
Order Form is only available in English

Payment terms
Minimum 12 months billed annually upfront via wire transfer
Sell the annual value of operations
The customer has the flexibility to use operations during the 12 months before expiring

Length of the contract
The minimum is 12 months but as a subscription-based business measured with ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), we highly promote multi-year deals (2, 3, and 4-years contracts)

Number of operations
The customer is granted an annual number of operations by signing the contract (e.g. 12,000,000 operations/year)
Operations do not roll over to the next year
Customers can flexibly use the operations during the year without any limitations

Overage
Usage beyond the assigned number of operations
The subscription doesn't stop after the operations run out, but there are overage rules
Over-usage of Operations beyond the scope of Operations per year outlined in this Order will be charged monthly in arrears at a fixed price per Package of 10,000 Operations

Pricing
Tier pricing based on the number of operations
With the higher number of operations, the price per 1m operations decreases while the effective discount increases
Discounts are possible but align and communicate with the GTM Sales team before making a commitment to the customer

Currency
It is possible to bill the customer in three different currencies (EUR, USD, GBP)

Stage 5 - Customer Onboarding & Post-sales

A quality handover to the Make Customer Success team is a critical success factor for onboarding but also sets the stage for all future to upsell potential at the account. Be personally accountable for the quality of the documentation and the initial meeting. To ensure success, if you are providing services should have already established an implementation plan which plays a crucial part in the adoption of Make and future upsell with the customer.



Important Process

Customer onboarding
AE fills out the onboarding form
If applicable SE prepares all scenarios to be migrated to the new Enterprise instance
Attend initial meeting with the Customer Success team, AE, and respective Solution Engineer 
Present implementation plan and align with the end customer
Post-sales Relationship managed by service partner and Customer Success team
Set up regular checks with the Customer Success team and the Account Executive to identify upsell opportunities
Desired Outcome

The Customer Success team has initiated the onboarding process and the customer is ready to be activated. Login information is provided and if necessary, the migration process to the new customerâ€™s instance has started. The implementation plan has been agreed upon and you are building a strong post-sales relationship with the end customer.
