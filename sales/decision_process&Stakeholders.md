Firstly, the chapter is going to focus on the Champion, then we are going to talk about the Ultimate Decision Maker, and lastly, we will cover the procurement part of the customer's organization and other possible opportunity sponsors.



## 1. Champion

  - The champion is a non-executive power user who is discovering, evaluating, and pitching Make to the executive decision maker
  - A champion is usually a functional leader that has a high influence on the CXO at the company
  - In bigger companies, the non-executive champion can be the decision maker and use the discretionary budget to fund the purchase of the tool
  - Champions highly benefit from implementing the tool which directly impacts their day-to-day functions
  - He/she is the person who faces a challenge and is looking for a solution

__Importance of the Champion__

  - High
  - It is very difficult to build a successful opportunity without an identified champion who is internally pushing for implementing the tool
    
__Typical titles of the Champion__

  - Heads of Operations (Sales, Marketing, HR, general operations)
  - Heads of Digital Innovation, Automation
  - IT or Product Managers
  - Sales, Marketing, and HR operations managers
  - Automation Engineers
  - Product engineers, owners, or managers

## 2. Ultimate Decision Maker

  - The ultimate decision-maker is the person who is going to make the final decision on the deal
  - This person can negotiate or just sign off the contract
  - In smaller companies (below ~200 FTEs) -  the full decision-making process including the evaluation and decision can be done by the ultimate decision maker (CXO)
    
__Importance of the Decision Maker__

  - Very high
  - It is impossible to close a deal without full alignment and buy-in of the ultimate decision maker
    
__Typical titles of the Decision Maker__

CTO, CPO, CIO, COO, CDO
CEO or co-founder in smaller companies below ~200 FTEs

## 3. Procurement team & other stakeholders

  - In larger companies (above ~1,000 FTEs), a more rigorous information security, procurement, and vendor assessment process is required
  - Final approval about the purchase of the tool is made by the procurement team
  - Make sure to identify the procurement stakeholders early before the final stages of the deal to avoid unnecessary delays before closing the deal
    
__Importance of the procurement team & other stakeholders__

  - Medium
  - They have requirements that need to be fulfilled, but if the expectations are aligned early enough during the sales cycle, they are not the ultimate red line within the opportunity
    
__Typical titles__

  - Head of procurement
  - Purchase lead
  - Vendor assessment team
