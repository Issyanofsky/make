## Make Target Market and its characteristics

In this lesson, we will guide you through the Make target market and its characteristics to ensure that you are focusing on the right companies and that you have identified their pain points which Make can solve. Even though we believe these are the right companies with the highest probability to succeed and end up as a new Make Enterprise customer, feel free to target companies outside of this target market based on your expertise and market knowledge. 

__This is what works well, but you as a partner have the best opportunity to enlarge this target market for new segments which we haven't explored yet.__ In general, we see the biggest success in companies that are:

  - Digitally native
  - Industry disruptors
  - Fast-growing start-ups and scale-ups in terms of the number of employees and revenues
  - Next-generation companies that have tremendous potential
  - Companies with high potential
    
__Here is a list of companies that fit into this description and are already satisfied Enterprise customers__

  - PayFit
  - Jellysmack
  - Swappie
  - BambooHR
  - OkCoin
  - Wolt
  - Spotify

Let's focus on the size of the market that is described above. There is a big number of companies that fit the description of fast-growing start-ups and scale-ups so a great opportunity lies in front of us in the case of the total addressable market. Here are some highlights from the visual below

- TAM (Total Addressable Market) = $2.5B
- number of digital native companies = around 75,000
- The number of scale-ups is growing rapidly = 14.5% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
  
The 3 main company types in this target market are:

1. Startups (Annual revenues between $1-40M)
2. High Growth (Annual revenues between $40-100M)
3. Large Scale-ups ($100+M)

![As muchas $2.5B lies in the digital natives market](/pic/size_digital_ative_market.gif)

The underlying fact is, that if Make penetrates only 10% of this market, the potential market share would result in $250M which is a tremendous potential.

Furthermore, we measure the company size based on its number of employees which represents well their growth and their need for automation tools such as Make. The reason for that is that only the annual revenue of the company sometimes cannot reflect the current pain points and challenges they face.

__Two main company size categories for Make are:__

1. Scale-ups and maturing startups = 50 - 1,000 FTEs (Full-time employees)
   - 80% of the current Enterprise customers
     
2. The front office of large corporations = +1,000 FTEs (Full-time employees)
