  - Scenarios of the end customer will not stop once the limit of operation is reached and the customer can leverage an overage price per operation in this case.
  - However, the consumption and adoption of customers are closely monitored by the Make customer success team which will communicate with the customer if the operations are about to run out before the end of the term.
